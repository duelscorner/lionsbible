# Starting Guide

Welcome to the starting guide to the Lion's Bible! I am happy that you at least were curious enough to check in, and I hope you are open minded enough to understand my reasons for making a new Bible version.

## What is the Lion's Bible?
The Lion's Bible is a new version based on the [King James Version](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/), and previous iterations of it. The KJV has been expanded to support more than the traditional Biblical canon, and has been modified to combat the corruption caused by what is commonly referred to as the Mandella Effect.

## How has the Biblical canon been modified?

Removed Books:
- Esther

Added Books:
- Yashar (Jubilees)
- 2 Ezra (2nd Esdras)
- Watchers (1 Enoch)
- Parables (1 Enoch)
- Luminaries (1 Enoch)
- Dreams (1 Enoch)
- Admonitions (1 Enoch)

## What does the Mandella Effect have to do with the Bible?
